# Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop a job application website  where employers can post job opportunities with their requirements and then hire a talent. 

It would also help job seekers search for jobs and apply for the job that suits their skill.
This simple job site would have a search box where job seekers can filter their search to meet their specific requirements instead of searching through tonnes of jobs that doesn't match their skills  in the website. They would be able to search not just through the profile or name of the job but also with any keyword in the job description and technologies required. This simply means whatever keyword they use would display a result specific to their search.
