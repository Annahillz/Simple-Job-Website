# Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop a job application website  where employers can post job opportunities with their requirements and then hire a talent. 

It would also help job seekers search for jobs and apply for the job that suits their skill.
This simple job site would have a search box where job seekers can filter their search to meet their specific requirements instead of searching through tonnes of jobs that doesn't match their skills  in the website. They would be able to search not just through the profile or name of the job but also with any keyword in the job description and technologies required. This simply means whatever keyword they use would display a result specific to their search.

### Maven
it is an open source build tool. It is used to build, publish, and deploy several projects at once for better project management.

### RESTFUL API
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a design philosophy that outlines a set of guidelines for using in the development of web services. REST API is a straightforward and flexible method of accessing web services without any processing. Because REST requires less bandwidth and is more suitable for internet use, it is often preferred to the more reliable Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology. It is utilized to obtain or provide data from an online service. Through the REST API, only HTTP requests are used for communication.
